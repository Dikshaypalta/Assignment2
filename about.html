<h2 style="color:yellow" align="center">HISTORY</h2>
<p><b>Prior to European exploration and settlement, the Windsor area was inhabited by the First Nations and Native Americans.<br>
A French agricultural settlement was established at the site of Windsor in 1749.<br> 
It is the oldest continually inhabited European-founded settlement in Canada west of Montreal.<br>
The area was first named la Petite Côte ("Little Coast" – as opposed to the longer coastline on the Detroit side of the river).<br>
Later it was called La Côte de Misère ("Poverty Coast") because of the sandy soils near LaSalle.</br></b></p>

<h2 style="color:yellow" align="center">Location</h2>
<p><b>Ouellette Avenue is the historic main commercial street in downtown Windsor.<br>
It runs north–south, perpendicular to the Detroit River, and divides the city into east and west sections. <br>
Roads that cross Ouellette Avenue include the directional components East and West after their names.<br>
 Address numbers on east–west roads in Windsor increase by 100 for each block travelled away from Ouellette Avenue and address numbers on north–south roads increase by 100 for each block travelled away from the Detroit River.<br> 
 In areas where the river curves, some numbers on north–south roads are skipped. <br>
 For consistency across the city, all address numbers on north–south roads reset at either 600, for streets west of Walker road, or 800 for those to the east, where the road crosses Wyandotte Street (which roughly parallels the Detroit River).<br></b></p>

<h2 style="color:yellow" align="center">Climate</h2>
<p><b>Windsor has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with four distinct seasons.<br>
[11][12] The mean annual temperature is 9.9 °C (50 °F), among the warmest in Canada primarily due to its hot summers.<br>
 Some locations in coastal and lower mainland British Columbia have a slightly higher mean annual temperature due to milder winter conditions there.<br> 
 The coldest month is January and the warmest month is July.<br>
 The coldest temperature ever recorded in Windsor was −32.8 °C (−27.0 °F) on January 29, 1873[13] and the warmest was 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) on June 25, 1988<br></b></p>

<h2 style="color:yellow" align="center">Tourism</h2>
<p><b>Windsor tourist attractions include Caesars Windsor, a lively downtown club scene, Little Italy, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, the Art Gallery of Windsor, the Odette Sculpture Park, Adventure Bay Water Park, and Ojibway Park.<br>
As a border settlement, Windsor was a site of conflict during the War of 1812, a major entry point into Canada for refugees from slavery via the Underground Railroad and a major source of liquor during American Prohibition.<br>
 Two sites in Windsor have been designated as National Historic Sites of Canada: the Sandwich First Baptist Church, a church established by Underground Railroad refugees, and François Bâby House, an important War of 1812 site now serving as Windsor's Community Museum.<br>
Capitol Theatre in downtown Windsor had been a venue for feature films, plays and other attractions since 1929, until it declared bankruptcy in 2007.<br>
Today, the theatre remains open.<br>
The Tea Party is an internationally famous progressive rock band which has been based in Windsor since its foundation in 1990.</br></b></p>
